# Continuity

Continuity is a Fabric mod built around modern APIs to allow for the most efficient connected textures experience possible. It is designed to provide full Optifine parity for all resource packs that use the Optifine/MCPatcher CTM format.

Continuity depends on the Fabric API and is client-side only. It includes two built-in resource packs - one provides default connected textures, similar to Optifine, and the other provides a fix for glass pane culling.

## Forge Version

Forge version of Continuity will not be made for the following reasons.

- Forge's model API: It is vastly different from Fabric's model API (FRAPI), which is readily utilized by Continuity, and switching to it would not only require an incredible amount of effort, but also result in the mod being extremely inefficient.
- Optifine: Optifine has native support for Forge and provides the same features as Continuity.
